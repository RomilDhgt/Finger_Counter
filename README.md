The code uses a hand tracking module to detect and track hand gestures from the laptop's camera feed. It overlays a hand mesh on the captured image and calculates the number of fingers held up, displaying the count and frames per second (FPS) on the screen. The finger count is determined based on the positions of specific landmarks corresponding to the thumb and fingers. The application runs in real-time, continuously updating the camera feed with hand tracking information and FPS display.
